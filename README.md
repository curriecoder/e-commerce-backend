## Description

This project was motivated by a desire to implement Sequelize to manage a back end database. I learned how to use sequelize on this project and I really appreciate this module after going through vanilla SQL first. This application solves the problem of not having a database for an e-commerce website.

## Usage

Instructions: Begin the application by running 'npm install' to install all dependencies. After installation is complete, log in to MySql and build the database with 'source schema.sql'. Quit out of MySql and then run 'npm run seed' to seed the database with some example data. The user can now test all of the C.R.U.D. operations for the E-Commerce Back End.

## Credits

I would first like to thank the instructors of UPenn LPS Coding Bootcamp class of 08-2021 for continually putting the students at the top of the importance list. As always, thanks to the community of devs that are there for me to rubber duck all of the issues I can't solve in my head.
